# React-Portfolio
An updated version of the original portfolios, created using React 18. 

  ## Description
  A React Portfolio that uses routing to navigate pages to present a single page application. Incorporates a Header component that is appears on the main container pages, the Header has a sub component of a Navigation Bar which uses React Routing to navigate around the site. The portfolio of projects is again a component which reads details about the projects from a json file and then displays them as individual cards within the Projrcts container. To ensure that accces to my CV was validated, I used Firebase to sent a authentication email to the requester, once the requester has validated their email address the button changes from 'Request' the 'Download and the requester can download the pdf.
