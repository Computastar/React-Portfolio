          <h2>Its All About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello, there fellow nerds, I'm Jason Hunter, an IT consultant from a time when RAM was measured in Kb not Gb. I live in God's own county of the Peoples Republic of Yorkshire, in His Majestyâ€™s United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland. I have spent over 30 years working in IT, mainly Windows based security and systems management consultancy. I've recently been transitioning to cloud-based technologies on the Azure stack, but this has highlighted the need for me to learn web development. So here I am, boot camping my way to web development.</p>
          <h2>A Particular Set of Skills</h2>
          <p>The skills Im looking to hone are HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in order that I can build dynamic frontends based on Blazor for Azure based apps</p>
